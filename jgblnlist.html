<h2>if you know of any others that arent here, feel free to let me know, you can probably use the bug report feature for this.<br> this is not a list of official PvZ games or mods for PvZ games</h2>
<h4>plants vs goblins</h4>
<p>probably the largest pvz ripoff there is, the following games are all part of the PVG franchise</p>
<p>plants vs goblins</p>
<p>plants vs goblins 2</p>
<p>plants vs goblins 3</p>
<p>plants vs goblins 4</p>
<p>plants vs goblins 5</p>
<p>plants vs goblins 6</p>
<p>plants vs goblins 7</p>
<h4>peashooter: superskills</h4>
<p>a bit more weird than PVG, but it has some unique mechanics that i dont see used anywhere else</p>
<p>peashooter: superskills has two official releases for android devices, one in english, and one in chinese</p>
<p>Disclaimer: i have no affiliation with popcap, EA, or any other companies or people whos game has been mentioned on this page, i am simply trying to document games that are simmilar to PvZ. i am NOT accusing anyone of IP theft.<br> if you are involved in the development of any games listed here and would like to discuss me changing the descriptions, feel free to contact me.</p>
