    <p>Grugland is probably my oldest project, and one of my favourites.</p>
    <button type="button" class="collapsible">History of Grugland</button>
    <div class="content">
    <p>i first decided i wanted to learn game development in early 2020, so i started comming up with ideas for a game with my friends.</p> 
    <p>it was mostly just disconnected mechanical ideas with little to no plot or characters, at the time it didnt even have a name</p>
    <p>i guess the best way to describe this early idea in terms of genre was something along the lines of a MMORPG-metroidvania</p>
    <p>i eventually set it aside to focus on other things, mostly forgeting about it.</p>
    <p>in 2022 i started learning how to draw properly, slowly developing my artstyle, it was arround this time i made the first character who would end up in grugland</p>
    <p>in 2024 me and a friend who we'll call "NOR" started designing dumb characters together, the first of which was my beloved Goor stain, and later creating a little gremlin named "Grug"</p>
    <p>Nor jokingly talked about making a game for these characters. i quickly started working on said game, using many ideas from the game i designed in 2020, except i actually made them semi-decent this time.</p>
    <p>sadly, due to my files getting corrupted, and me realising that i had no clue how to make the game play well, i cancelled development of grugland in early 2025</p>
